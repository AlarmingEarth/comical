Comical
=======

Comical is a basic comic book creator/viewer Web App.  
See an example [here](https://comical.glitch.me/).  

User Guide
----------
Edit the comic data (JSON format) using the included editor to arrange your comic.

Use the editor to change the title, layout and declare your own comic panels. 
Specify an image URL for each panel along with its placement in the layout and an optional caption.

The layout uses a grid system based on CSS grid where each row is defined by an array of values which map the panels to the grid according to their placement attribute.

Use the 'Text' view in the editor to copy the JSON to your own file to save offline and paste in later.
